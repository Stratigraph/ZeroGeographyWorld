	abstract = {{"Robert} Axelrod's extraordinary book, The Evolution of Cooperation was globally acclaimed for the rich results of its simple model. The Complexity of Cooperation now gathers together the myriad fruits of more than a decade's work, carefully 'complexifying' his initial model. Like his ideas, his prose is clear and engaging. His delight as he unveils each surprising discovery is infectious. This book is not merely important; it's fun."--Robert D. Putnam, author of Making Democracy {WorkRobert} Axelrod is widely known for his groundbreaking work in game theory and complexity theory. He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the {field.The} articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction betweenindividuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity},

This is mirrored by the existence and advent of an array of methods and theories that describe complex social phenomena, including in International Relations ({IR).} However, many scholars fall short of explaining what it is they call ‘complexity’, how the notion of complexity can help to better understand {IR} and which kinds of methodologies support such analyses. This article provides an overview and critical discussion of the latter. The notion of complexity and its underlying concepts are briefly clarified and methodological aspects and challenges are discussed. It is explained which social phenomena within the realm of {IR} are most promisingly studied under a complexity paradigm. Three modelling examples are given for illustration that allow for the identification of methodological and epistemological limits and the anticipation of potential prospects of a complexity-based modelling approach to {IR.}},

	abstract = {This study investigated the impact of the micro-level factors on the pattern of the system-level properties in international relations, and the impact of dyadic and systemic factors on the probability of war. Considering that existing simulation models in international relations have focused on the conflict dimension, this study tried to integrate the cooperative dimension of world politics in order to see what would happen in the integrated model. Computer simulations, using the cellular automata framework and the complex systems theory, were designed to generate artificial datasets for testing the nine propositions related to major international relations theories.
Three major tasks were undertaken in this study. First, a replicated model of security-only world was compared to a newly integrated model of the security-and-trade world on three dependent variables--system endurance, balance-of-power, and state survival rate. The introduction of trade into the model made system endurance more probable than the security-only world. The probability of deterrent balance-of-power increased in the security-and-trade world, while there was little difference in defensive balance-of-power. State survival rate increased with the trade module, but system-level factors had more impact than state-level factors in the security-and-trade world.
Second, the integrated model of war and trade was also used to test the relationship between dyadic factors--economic interdependence and heterogeneity--to the probability of war. In this cellular automata world, the increase of economic interdependence reduced the probability of war. The type of dyads, measured by the heterogeneity in state power, had a great impact on the probability of war, too. Wars happened the most frequently in the minor-minor dyad, while major states were more prudent in starting war.
The third task concerned the impact of systemic factors--polarity and power concentration--on the probability of war. Multipolar worlds were the most war-prone, while unipolar worlds were the least. A similar result appeared with the number of major powers, instead polarity, as the explanatory variable. Also the power concentration among major powers was found to show an inverted U-shaped curve with the probability of war lowest when the number of great powers was two or three.},

The theory leads to the seemingly obvious generalization that actors do not initiate wars--or serious disputes--if they do not expect to gain from doing so. Underlying that generalization are a number of counterintuitive deductions. For instance, I show that though a weak nonaligned state cannot rationally attack a stronger nonaligned nation, it might be able to attack a stronger adversary that, in addition to its own strength, expects to derive support from allies. I also show that serious conflict is more likely between very close allies than between enemies. Systematic tests, using data on serious international threats, military interventions, and interstate wars, as well as 17 cases of known attempts at deterrence, show very substantial support for the expected utility propositions deduced from the theory.},

However, the testing of the theory has lagged behind its theoretical development. In its most sophisticated formulation, the theory has been tested on only 707 dyad-years, all drawn from Europe between 1816 and 1970. We present a test of the expected utility theory of war (as developed in War and Reason) on the international system from 1816 to 1984. Specifically, we examine the relationship between the main equilibrium variables derived under the “domestic variant” of the international interaction game and behavioral outcomes using multinomial logit. We find that the equilibria correlate with actual behavior in both the set of all dyads and a subset of politically relevant dyads, even after including a set of control variables. The relationship is somewhat less clear among the population of all interstate-directed dyads, however, with key equilibrium variables having smaller effects at increasing the odds of interstate conflict among all dyads. We also present a new software program, {EUGene}, which generates expected utility data and can serve as an important data management tool for international relations researchers.},

With most of its fundamental concepts and frameworks rooted in the study of international relations ({IR)}, the field of security studies has failed to keep up. Highly educated soldiers and diplomats sent to help rebuild failed or fragmented states are still poorly equipped to identify major obstacles or formulate solutions for accomplishing their missions. The safety of states and societies today depends less exclusively on blocking the military, economic, and ideological initiatives of a foreign power and more on supporting the integrity of members that can participate in an international system regulated by generally agreed-upon rules and conventions. The need to help various types of states under a variety of cultural and economic conditions build legitimate, durable political institutions and functioning societies should push security studies toward a broader examination of comparative politics. Beyond the balance of power and modalities of interstate competition, the new security studies should embrace fundamentals found outside of {IR} to make more robust intellectual contributions to the examination of comparative defense.},
